## Project Overview

I developed a React application with a Node.js and Express backend. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the following technologies and concepts:

- **React Router DOM:** For efficient routing and navigation.
- **Component Rendering:** Creating and managing reusable UI components.
- **Props in React:** Passing data between components to ensure seamless functionality.
- **React Toastify:** Implementing notifications for better user feedback.
- **React Redux:** Managing the application state across components for real-time updates.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Using MongoDB for persistent data storage.
- **APIs:** Building and consuming RESTful APIs to connect the frontend with the backend.
- **Authentication:** Implementing user sign-in and secure access control.

The project is hosted on Netlify, providing a live and accessible online presence.
